## from another planet
Your space ship is lost in an unidentified area far away from your home planet. Finish the objective and fight your way through to reach home safely (under development)

When the enemies reach the other end of the screen, player loses a life. Moreover, the rocks and red laser/log instantly kill the player on contact
